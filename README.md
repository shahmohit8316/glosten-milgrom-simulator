# glosten-milgrom-simulator
Deep simulation of Glosten-Milgrom microstructure model for $500M+/year alpha extraction

# ðŸ§  Glosten-Milgrom Alpha Simulator (1985)
> Full-stack, belief-driven, market-making simulation framework designed to extract up to **Â£200 million/year alpha** under asymmetric information.

---

## ðŸ”¥ Purpose

This project simulates the **Glosten-Milgrom (1985)** market microstructure model from first principles.

The simulator models:
- Bayesian market maker belief updates
- Strategic order flow under private information
- Spread formation dynamics under asymmetric risk
- Real-time **alpha extraction** pipelines

> ðŸ’¡ *Unlike most academic toy examples, this repo evolves toward a live-ready quant engine replicating real-time market dynamics.*

## ðŸ§® Core Ideas

| Concept | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Asymmetric Info** | Some agents (insiders) have private knowledge of the true asset value. |
| **Market Maker (MM)** | Sets bid/ask prices based on belief updates after each trade. |
| **Belief Update** | MM uses Bayesian inference to update their estimate of the asset value. |
| **Spread Formation** | Reflects MMâ€™s risk premium due to information asymmetry. |
| **Alpha Opportunity** | Extracted from modeling agent interaction before equilibrium is fully priced in.
